            <!--Similar to the home and about page, I will be using a series of h2 tags,
            image tags, and paragraph tags to give a crashcourse lesson on Magic: the
            Gathering for the consumers that are less familiar with the game. Since
            a ton of MtG knowledge is not necessray, this will be confided in one page and 
            will also include links for them to read more if interested.-->

            <!--Also, to keep the page relevant, I will focus more on talking about things such
            as formats, rules, and deck architypes, as I want to focus less on "how to play"
            and more on "how to watch and understand what is going on".-->

            <!--I am not trying to get the audience here to play MtG, I'm trying to get them
            to watch the pro scene of MtG (so they can use my website for articles and draft).-->
